# GoFutbol Soccer Application

To run:
Install http-server via npm. If you don't have npm yet:
`$ curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`

Once you have npm:
`$ npm install http-server -g`

This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.

From the gofutbol folder run http-server:
`$ http-server`

Go to localhost:8080 in your browser and enjoy.
